I'm Edd, and welcome to my portion of the internet.

I have a diverse set of interests spanning free software, tea appreciation, hardware hacking, and electronic music production.  My beliefs include that [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) is only used by the malicious, that self-referential comedy is the best kind[^1], and that it's hard to stop using the [slippery slope argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope) once you begin.  More seriously, I hold a firm conviction that Jesus is the Christ; fundamentally, I'm passionate that more people should come to know Him as Lord.

I graduated from the University of Oxford with a Masters' in Computer Science in 2020, and went on to found [Dreaming Spires](https://dreamingspires.dev): a freelance software consultancy group for research software.

When at Oxford, I was involved in various hackathons, becoming Sponsorship Director for the [Oxford Hack 2019](https://oxfordhack.joshuasmailes.co.uk/)[^2], and venturing on various exploits across the globe with [Team Brewlabs](https://gitlab.com/teambrewlabs).  I co-led St. Catz Christian Union from 2017-2018, and took up the mantle as CU tech leader from 2018-2019.  During 2020, I developed my singing skills with St. John's college choir.  Throughout, I also developed my DJing and music production skills; someday I plan to release my backlog of finished music.

In the summer of 2020, I worked at Deloitte within Cyber Incident Response.  In that time, I built and deployed an EDR system within 8 weeks that was deployed in production across the Deloitte UK cyber infrastructure, leading down the research path that lead to my Masters' thesis.

I wrote my Bachelors' thesis on Resurrecting the Manchester Mark 1 Reduced Machine, a never-built architecture described by Alan Turing that paved the way for the first commercially available computer[^3].  I synthesised the circuitry onto an FPGA, describing the hardware as deconstructed from the original patent in Verilog, and ran some of the original software on it.

I wrote my Masters' thesis on a novel approach for threat detection within Incident Response, which may yet come to fruition.

When I write software, I almost certainly release it on my [GitHub](https://github.com/eddsalkield/).
