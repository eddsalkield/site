For a computer scientist, it might seem odd that I found school ICT lessons deathly boring.  They were by far my least favourite of all lessons, despite nominally being about a topic of great interest to me.  Why?

We spent many lessons "learning" skills on Microsoft office, such as formatting text and saving documents, all the while being told how useful these skills would one day be to us.  Riveting, right?  And at the end, some flaming pile of proprietary garbage testing software would attempt to determine your proficiency, while notably marking as incorrect any solutions that involved any sort of creative approach to the problem[^2].  Spoon-fed solutions only, please.

I was fortunate to have been taught by my dad and grandfather the basics of computer operation and programming, but only enough to know how little I actually knew.  Each lesson, I would submit the same question to the teacher: "when are you going to teach us _real_ programming?".  Usually, these were met with an ignored response.

However, on one particular occasion, my exasperated teacher met my protest with an ultimatum: "If you're so good at computers, why not take the test _right now_"?

"Alright" I said, and proceeded to complete the test, notably failing a question about copy and pasting which didn't accept solutions involving the keyboard shortcuts of Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.

In my questioning, I genuinely wasn't attempting to cause an altercation.  But I knew that this was a lesson in information and _computing_ technology, and I was supremely interested in how computers worked.  And I knew that what we were learning wasn't it.  I was always promised that we'd learn some day, but within the confines of ICT, that day never came.

From HN comment by grapeshot:
> ...it's very difficult to find an answer if you don't know how to describe the problem.

For almost any other question that arose in school, I had recourse for my curiosity.  I could categorise a question in terms of a subject we learned.  I could then talk with the associated teacher.  They might help me to find out sufficient context to crystallise some deeper questions.  Even if often met with the "you'll learn about it at A Level"[^2] moniker, I could at least find out where to get started!

But the story was so different for computer science.  I was fortunate enough to have been given my first taste of programming at a young age, so I knew that computers were logical machines whose behaviour was determined by programs, written by people.  But despite this head start, it only give me the foundation to express that I wanted to learn "about programming".  More precise questions were inaccessible; I knew insufficient context.

And this is fundamentally where ICT failed.  The problem wasn't that my ICT teacher was unable to teach me computer science, at least not any more than my physics teacher wasn't able to illuminate much about wave-particle duality.  The issue is that the subject, as then structured, gave no framework through which I could get started in the field.  It was no good asking my ICT teacher about anything, and even less good asking a knowledgable programmer such a non-specific question.  I was stuck  I was stuck.

Taking a step back, the reason we structure the world and its knowledge into subjects is twofold; that we first learn to refine our exploration to relevant areas, and secondly gain sufficient context within those areas to ask good questions.  The former allows us to contextualise a curiosity in terms of other things that we know.  The latter allows us to refine our search, going deeper into the subject.

If a subject fails to make clear its context within the broader curriculum, then it's of no use.  Take rhetoric: if only taught in the abstract, students won't think of applying good argumentative style when debating with their friends.

Conversely, if a subject fails to teach generalisable skills, then it's of no use to anyone in answering questions beyond that which they learned by rote.

But if taught together, the impact is powerful: generalisable skills are ingrained, sufficient to help students grapple with important aspects of life.  We give them a toolkit that enables them to crystallise specific questions about the world.  Instead of suppressing curiosity, we stimulate its thinking to its conclusion.

When we learned in DT about the design of a clock, it was never intended that we should go on to make use of our specific clock-making skills.  It was the journey to making a clock that taught us basic woodworking techniques.  We learned that there existed teachers that knew a lot about woodworking, and could help us learn more if we wanted.  So now, when bored in some other class and curious about their pencil, a student could look at the object and think:

I wonder how pencils get made?

Well, pencils are made of wood.

My DT teacher taught us woodworking.  I'll talk to him to find out more about how pencils get made.

And, chances are, that your DT teacher _will_ know something about how pencils get made - or at least enough to refer you onto some interesting resources that explain in more detail.

But let's go through the same example within ICT:

The student wonders "I wonder how the screen is able to show images at my command?"

But they don't have the framework to know that a mobile phone _is_ a general purpose computer[^4] - how can they be expected to make the link that they need to ask their ICT teacher?

Suppose that the student does work out that their teacher can help them learn about digital technology.  They're standing at the precipice of understanding about logic, computer programs, rendering technologies.  But how can they get started, when all they know is that computers can be used to process word documents, and surf the internet?

Unable to formulate a good question, and with a similarly clueless teacher, the student resigns this question to an increasingly growing list of "unknowables".  What a tragedy!

The problem, therefore, with ICT is that it failed to teach even the most basic fundamentals about general purpose computers, instead opting to teach mind-numbing office skills, the sorts of things that would have been learned anyway as students wrote essays and presentations for other subjects!  No doubt the Microsoft lobbyists were proud of their work: head teachers didn't have to go out to find somebody with a good understanding of how computer science fits within the fabric of society, when a glorified office clerk would do!







== Purpose of a school ==

A sign of a remarkable school is that, for any given domain of interest, a student should be able to know how to begin.

Ongoing education is a process of intrigue leading to exploration.

Students should leave school knowing how to express curiosity in the world.  If anything is to be squashed out of the student mindset, it has to be the "can't do" attitude.

In this, traditional ICT skills fail: of course, learning to use office applications may be useful to an employer.  But it doesn't stimulate curiosity.  And it certainly doesn't teach any sort of generalisable skill!

Educational institutions should not, therefore, be embracing with open arms technologies that prohibit understanding.

[^4] Well, at the very least, a locked-down version of one.  I might write a future blog post about how closed source software is great at cracking down on curious minds.
